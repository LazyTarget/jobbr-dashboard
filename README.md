# Jobbr Dashboard [![Develop build status][dashboard-badge-build-develop]][dashboard-link-build]

This is a storage provider implementation for the [Jobbr .NET JobServer](http://www.jobbr.io) to store artefacts related from job runs on the filesystem in a folder of your choice. 
The Jobbr main repository can be found on [JobbrIO/jobbr-server](https://github.com/jobbrIO).

## Installation
First of all you'll need a working jobserver by using the usual builder as shown in the demos ([jobbrIO/jobbr-demo](https://github.com/jobbrIO/jobbr-demo)). In addition to that you'll need to install the NuGet Package for this extension.

### NuGet

    Install-Package Jobbr.Dashboard

### Configuration
Since you already have a configured server, the registration of the provider is quite easy. See Example below

```c#
using Jobbr.Dashboard

/* ... */

var builder = new JobbrBuilder();

builder.AddDashboard(config =>
{
    config.BackendAddress = "http://localhost:1337/jobbr-dashboard";
});

server.Start();
```
